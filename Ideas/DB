1. Add a dual NoSQL for cart orders and wishlist.

2. At some point, you'll want to consider having separate tables to dynamically generate part 
of the descriptions for certain categories of items. For example, we know all books have a 
unique synopsis - that will be in the description column of your Product table. However, 
all books also share certain types of properties, such as author, number of pages, publisher, 
publication date.  So you could have a Book Detail table connected to your Categories table 
with each of those fields. Using those fields, you could dynamically generate part of the 
description - this will allow you to better standardize the look of your item listings 
(you can guarantee that every single book listing will have at least those pieces of detail).

3. It's probably too early for this, but at some point you'll want to consider a browsing history 
table connected to the User table. This will allow you to display recommendations to the user 
based on their previous browsing history (you can use order history for this as well.

4. I'm not quite sure how you sync this up to work with PayPal, but at some point 
(perhaps far into the future) you'll want to consider giving users the option to pay with gift cards.
